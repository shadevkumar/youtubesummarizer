all right so a few things have been happening in open source there's some sort of a controversy that that was sort of inevitable if I'm being honest though in this video I'm going to talk about um a few dos and don'ts if you're thinking of contributing to open source what are the controversies that are happening how much I think I have a part to play in it and what are the measures that I've taken to prevent it and the things that you should do if you're thinking of contributing to open source from India Pakistan generally southeast Asia I think there are a few things that we're doing wrong which we can improve upon so let's talk about that in this video let me set some context first U there are a few videos that a few YouTubers made which was they were related to you know a lot of Indians contributing to open source not the right way what's not the right way her kirat um making a lot of typo changes documentation changes filling up 40 50 pull requests in one day tagging a lot of maintainers creating a lot of issues in their heads making the lives generally of maintainers very miserable I have personally been a maintainer and sort of seen this firsthand do I understand the problem the reason this problem sort of happened was because there's a wave of two things in India one you can get a t-shirt via October Fest two you might get a job if you contribute to open source this led to a lot of Indians sort of flocking to these organizations and making bad contributions so that's what's happening this has been happening for a while now it's only that it's come to light now a little too much thanks to people making videos on it so let's talk about um if you are still thinking of contributing to open source which if I'm being honest just don't I don't think there's too much upside to contributing to open source the wrong way what is the wrong way I'll talk about U but if we were still thinking of doing it um a few don'ts to keep in mind first um number one don't make typo documentation fixes just leave it to other people you want a job as an engineer you want to be an engineer you don't want to make these changes they don't help you at all other than testing your G GitHub skills which you can do on any other project no one's hiring someone who makes a documentation change if I'm being honest this is an anti- signal no good engineer would spend time you know making typo fixes in fact Engineers dread that so don't make any such changes these just pollute the number of poll requests and it's really hard for maintainers to look at the real ones number two contributing without setting up the project um I think in this Chase of contributing really quickly to get ahead of everyone people don't even set up the project they just try to fix it some way you know make some code change which is is again good as a beginner to test things out but not at all a good contribution you want to make you don't even know the fix that you've made has actually worked and hence if that is the case it did not fix it which most probably it will be if you've not set up the project locally it'll just you know
